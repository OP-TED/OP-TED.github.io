<p>The WG discussed some issues discovered from the latest version of the OWL;</p>

<p>As next steps of the Ontology, the WG indicated that the Norwegians want to explain DCAT and facilitate discusion. The WG started discussing topics related to DCAT and the new release that is still under development from W3C.</p>

<p>Some members of the WG saw the need to take into account dcat and we recommend to use DCAT for the datasets generated.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: LocationCoordinate</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Giorgia Lodi explained an issue in the BDTI pilot when querying addresses. The queries get very complicated because there are many indirections between classes and properties, as well as redundancies between properties (like, for example, longitude and latitude degrees and Measure unitCodes, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One simplification proposed by Giorgia for the location of a specific spot in geometry/geography would be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>epo:LocationCoordinate epo:Latitude rdfs:Literal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>epo:LocationCoordinate epo:Longitude rdfs:Literal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>epo:LocationCoordinate epo:Altitude rdfs:Literal</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG agreed on having the attributes epo:Altitude, epo:Latitude, epo:Longitude as epo:Text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG decided to change the cardinality of the attributes to reflect what is in the predicate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG agreed that we need to define the cardinalities of the attributes. 0..* by default. Indicators 0..1, the rest of attributes we need to check them one by one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Roles and Subroles</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>

<li>
<p>The WG explained the current situation and approach using the reification class for the roles and subroles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TC440 eCatalogue convenor contributed saying that the Organisation that provides a catalogue, and the organisations that receives and process the catalogue. The rest (originator, etc. would be there):</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Modelling activities</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Wg discussed on how to model the different roles activities in the ontology. The following discussion took place:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG proposes to be flexible and open so linking as many different code lists to the generic reification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision about certain roles like the organisation providing tax information, and similar, had been that these should go linked to the Agent (as in the ePO version 2.0.1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In general the rule would be: if the agent is not directly involved in a procurement situation, but the procurement situation needs to use that agent or any other participants needs to be aware of their existence and activity, then these agents should not be linked to the reification as a role. In ePO 2.0.1 this works like this: the Agent is linked to another [range] class via a particular "predicate" (property) that explains/describes the activity developed by the Agent. In any case these properties MUST be attached to the Agent, not the role classes.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussions: OWL script errors</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG used the attendance of a consultant to analyse how to improve/correct the scripts for the transformation of the UML diagrams into OWL files:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some errors still persisting were discussed and marked as 'action points':</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>duplicity of the same property as DataType and ObjectType;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>class attributes of type 'Code' are pointing to classes representing codelists, when they should be pointing to "<em>skos:Concepts</em>";</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning the datatypes listed in the UML2RDF mapping (<a href="https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/config/ePO-default/umlToXsdDataTypes.xml" class="bare">https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/config/ePO-default/umlToXsdDataTypes.xml</a>) XSL-T artefact, the WG decided to change the data type marked as "<em>epo:Text</em>" (which ended up previously into "<em>rdf:langString</em>") into "<em>rdfs:Literal</em>". Confirmed that this does not impact on the TED-RDF mappings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this discussion, the script will be reviewed and the errors reported fixed by end of the week. Once the errors fixed and a new updated version of the script available, the OWL files will be generated again (this is an action point for everis).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Roles activities</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed the activity roles and how they should be modeled into the ePO ontology. For that purpose, the WG analysed the different existing codelists used in the ontology and which includes activities that are performed by roles. For example, the codelist organisation-subrole was analysed and the WG discussed whether the different activities listed in this codelist should be moved into the activity-type codelist which is linked to the reification class. The same discussion took place for the eo-role-type codelist that comes from ESPD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG asks to retrieve the analysis done in previous sessions about the roles and subroles, and to present a proposal in the context of the works done around the reifications reuniting "Agent, Role, Lot, Activities, other".</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We modified the minutes from the past 24th of November 2020 to reword some sentences that needed clarification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The axiom "<em>epo:CentralPurchasingBody epo:has epo:Buyer</em> profile" was finally removed from the EAP file, since it had been indicated in the minutes but was not applied yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new axiom "<em>epo:Buyer epo:hasBuyerProfile epo:BuyerProfile</em>" has been created in v2.0.2, this way this version is harmonised to v2.0.1 (in the previous v2.0.2 version the subject was epo:Agent). In v2.0.1 the predicate is still "<em>epo:has</em>", since  we cannot change it due to the TED-RDF mapping (currently ongoing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property "<em>usesBuyerProfile</em>", between "<em>epo:Agent</em>" and "<em>epo:BuyerProfile</em>" has been removed: it does not bring any semantics that can be correctly interpreted in eNotification.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: OWL files</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The meeting was focused on the review of the datatypes used in v2.0.1 and the generation of the OWL files. The need for this discussion came from some errors detected in the OWL files generated automatically with the OP scripts: <a href="https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl" class="bare">https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this sense, the WG worked exclusively on version 2.0.1 of the ontology to see which datatypes are used and which ones are not needed. See the common package ( <a href="https://eprocurementontology.github.io/v2.0.1/HTML/index.html" class="bare">https://eprocurementontology.github.io/v2.0.1/HTML/index.html</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG also reviewed the datatypes listed in the transformation file for the production of the OWL files. See <a href="https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/config/ePO-default/umlToXsdDataTypes.xml" class="bare">https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl/blob/master/config/ePO-default/umlToXsdDataTypes.xml</a> the corresponding file. The WG changed the mapping and the UML (we removed unnecessary Datatypes) and produced new OWl core, restriction, and shacl files for the version 2.0.1 UML. These changes will be applied in v2.0.2, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Channel class</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed whether the channel should be also linked to the ProcurementSituation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG indicated that if we adopt the reification in a future version, the property "has" between Role and ContactPoint should be removed, because too generic in its semantics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed whether the class BuyerProfile should be removed or not. The WG indicated that this class has been used in the TED-RDF mappings. The WG saw that the BuyerProfile is used differently in the v2.0.1. The WG discussed which way is the proper one to use the BuyerProfile class. The WG also indicated that using the BuyerProfile we are losing the consistency to the CPSV.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In v2.0.1 the Buyer is directly connected to the BuyerProfile, whilst in v2.0.2 it is not. The WG decided that v2.0.2 should be connected also be connected to Buyer directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BuyerProfile is a type of Channel, which is correct and it was not modelled like that in v2.0.1. However, in v2.0.1 this cannot be changed (and will be kept as it is now).</p>

<p>Will remove the axiom "epo:CentralPurchasingBody epo:has epo:BuyerProfile" in all versions where it is still remaining, starting with v.2.0.1.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The 3rd. November&#8217;s minutes were slightly changed. The paragraph starting with the following sentence was added (just below a UML diagram): "The inclusion of the role and the agent in the generic reification class "ProcurementSituation" makes unnecessary the axioms that we have in versions 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 "epo:Agent epo:playsRole epo:Role and the inverse epo:Role epo:isPlayedBy epo:Agent".</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: OWL files – OWL script</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed two issues related to the script developed by OP to transform the UML into OWL:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[#issue 261](<a href="https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/261" class="bare">https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/261</a>)</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After that, the work on analysis for testing the reification approach(for which use a copy of v2.0.2) was resumed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The diagram on Buyer and Organisation was re-discussed and the question of whether this diagram is needed or not was raised, since in the Agent diagram most of the classes related to Organisations are already covered there. The decision was to keep it, since the Agent diagram does not refer to Buyer nor BuyerProfile (and these are relevant from the Buyer perspective).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The object property “ownedBy” from Channel to Agent was removed. It seemed not necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cardinality of the object property "hasRole" between the ProcurementSituation and the Role was modified. Now it is: “*” situation has just “1” role, meaning that one instance of situation involves/affects just 1 Role and, in the opposite sense, one Role may be involved in more than one Procurement Situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between Buyer and Procedure has been also removed, since what is important is getting to the Agent playing the role of Buyer (see figure below). Roles are not connected directly to the Agent anymore (they do indirectly through the Procurement Situations). Therefore, a solution needs to be found to connect the Agent playing the role of Buyer to the Procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Award Decision-related reification</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG continued discussing on the reification class and its use in the award phase. The main discussions and modeling actions were:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of the Class AwardDecisionDetails has been changed to AwardDecisionAssignation, since the semantics of this class is rather about the assignation of the Award to the role Winner (and the agent behind this role).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also the predicates related to the AwardDecision reification class, as well as the predicates used by the generic ProcurementSituation have been revised and defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While working with the naming of these predicate, the following action point was raised: Create two Issues asking (1) how the transformation artefact could be able to generate object properties when the domains are multiple and different (and possible disjoint); and (2), are object subproperties being automatically and inherit from the appropriate parent object property?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG has relinked Subcontract to the reification AwardDecisionAssignation instead of to the AwardDecision class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG defined the class cav:AwardDecisionAssignation as: "The attribution of something that is assigned to something else "The situation where one Lot is awarded (or not) to a Winner&#8217;s TenderLot and its subcontracted part(s)."</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Roles and Subroles</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A quick recap was done explaining that in the last meeting the WG worked on the eOrdering and the reification classes, putting together the agent, the roles, and the order. The WG during such meeting came up with a final decision indicating that the ontology is reusing the class participation from the cpsv and making the epo:ProcurementSituation as an extension of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking into account the same above approach, prepared a diagram with the same point for the AwardDecision situation. Everis also created a set of examples to test the model. So the purpose of the meeting was to test the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explanation of the turtle file created for the testing purpose. Doing this test, everis saw important things to be commented on with the WG. For example, the namespace of the cpsv goes to the core vocabularies landing page. The WG tried to get the owl file but the system retrieves the html page and not the cpsv-ap turtle fie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another thing discovered was the epo:Agent inherits from foaf:agent, but was decided to inherit it from cpsv:Agent and the WG said that the cpsv:Agent inherit from foaf, but that is not true, they inherit from dct:Agent. The WG indicated that CPSV is changing this, so for the time being the WG agreed to come back and to inherit the epo:Agent from the foaf:Agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG went through the Abox example created to see how the model would be represented in RDF. Everis confirmed that the current model works if. From the discussion, the WG proposed why not to rename the AwardDecisionSitutation as AwardDecisionDetail since it provides the details of the AwardDecision of the Procedure:</p>

<p>Once reviewed the minutes of the last week, the WG continued with the discussions on the eOrdering model. Based on the minutes from the 27th and 29th of October, the following discussions took place:</p>

<p>The WG saw that the properties from OrderingSituration to the different roles are not needed because the OrderingSituation which a ProcurementSituation already involves roles:</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The inclusion of the role and the agent in the generic reification class "ProcurementSituation" makes unnecessary the axioms that we have in versions 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 "epo:Agent epo:playsRole epo:Role and the inverse epo:Role epo:isPlayedBy epo:Agent". The inclusion of the epo:involvesRole in the reification, subclasses now the CPSV-AP property "cps-av:role" (we are reusing the cpsv-ap:Participation class and its attibute "role", which points to a "skos:Concept" (see the UML diagram for more details). Therefore, if we end up implementing the reifications as represented in the UML diagram above, the relation between roles and agents would have to be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG asked why we are inheriting Agent and ProcurementSituation from the CPSV and the conclusion was that we are inheriting Agent and ProcurementSituation from the cpsv:Agent and cpsv:Participation for two reasons/benefits: (1)for the benefits of alignment ontologies (e.g. SDG), (2) doing this alignment we also solve other problems like how the agent is being modeled through the reuse of the cpsv agent.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed what are the objectives of the RoleAssignment class and how to use it. The WG indicated that the RoleAssignment links an Agent to a Role for a given planned action or rule that will need to be executed. Also, the assignments are expected to become situational facts during the fulfillment of the planned actions. From this discussion the following points were also discussed:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed which is the rule that says that an organization is a deliveree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG indicated that there missing elements in the model to describe the workflow that happens in the execution of some ordering activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG saw and discussed the need to model all the rules related to the Ordering. First of all, the WG asked what is a rule. The WG discussed the meaning of rule and indicates that it is an ordering term. Then they clarified what is a term defining it as a very particular rule or a collection of rules. Therefore the difference between Term and Assignment is that a term is a collection of rules while the assignment plan from role to an agent is capture between properties that link the term to this Procurement situation. From this discussion, the WG decided the Ordering situation is the reification allows us to connect the ordering rules to the different roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG added predicates to the properties that link OrderingSituation class to the different roles that already exist, like Seller and Buyer. The deliveree and the deliverer and the originator are not planned, the predicates contain the Planned concept.</p>

<p>The WG indicates that the OrderingSituation does not describe facts, but intentions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This participation class from the CPSV vocabulary was analysed to see how it is related to our situation (Procurement Situation). As a conclusion of the analysis, the WG decided to add this class into our model and reuse the CPSV vocabulary. This class is used for the generalisation of the ProcurementSituation. The WG also added to the UML diagram the class skos:Concept to be coherent to the CPSV and to align the ePO Role to the fact that in the CPSV-AP the roles are skos:Concept(s). The WG also agreed to remove the relation between roles and agent because we are adopting or reusing the CPSV participation class.</p>

<p>Also the WG indicates that we are inheriting Agent and ProcurementSituation from the cpsv:Agent and cpsv:Participation by two reasons/benefits: (1)for the benefits of allignment ontologies (e.g. SDG), (2) doing this alignment we also solve other problems like how agent is being modeled through the reuse of the cpsv agent.

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: eOrdering</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG continued the discussion from the 20th of October concerning electronic ordering terms.
The idea that we may be in front of two different patterns or models emerged a couple of times: one for
<em>ex-ante</em> "rules and terms" (e.g. what needs to be done for eOrdering), and another for <em>ex-post</em> "situations" (what
was actually done during the eOrdering). The general feeling of the WG was, however, that both situations are very complicated
and that there should be one single and coherent model to represent both situations. The WG had the feeling that the eProcurement process will need information
about the ex-ante and ex-post, maybe having two reification class, but this needs more discussions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analysis of "Ordering Terms" led to consider whether the class "Term" could become a reification class or not, since some of the attributes
of the class seem to be necessary in the reification (at least those referring to Agent and Role). This analyses was not covered during the meeting, since
the WG ran out of time. It was proposed to take examples from invoicing to complete the analysis in subsequent meetings, since the Invoice may
have more terms and data relating Agent to Role and, possibly, to other data necessary in the reification. Cécile Guash commited to send examples on
this (which we did: see CG email to the WG, subject "example invoice", 22 Oct. 17:25).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this meeting the main discussed points were:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG though that we need to have the ex-ante assignment of roles to agents because it is needed for the notification phase
(a class RoleAssignment was originally proposed for this, but was not added to the UML diagram since it needs further analysis). This
assignment would be differentiated from the Terms in eOrdering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG saw examples of ordering and some roles involved in it. Looking to the examples, the WG saw that it is possible to map them with
the current model, but there is more content where we will need to add more entities to the model to cover the entire Ordering data that may
or may not be related to eOrdering Terms.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG saw also from the example the possible need to add the 'Period' which is an informational data. This Period should be part of the
reification ordering class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing what is in UBL and CEN TC 440, the WG thought that maybe it is not needed to map the XML models to the ePO is not possible nor
convenient. Thus, for example,  according to one of these XML-based models, the delivery term has an attribute "location", whilst in ePO we
already have the class Location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG agrees that as soon we come up with a solution we need to test it immediately with real data samples.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: eOrdering</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG continued working on the creation of the eOrdering diagram. The WG merged the Model were there was the eOrdering with the model where the work about roles and activites (subroles) is also being developed.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above mentioned diagram it is possible to observe that WG was focused on the development of the eOrdering from the Roles perspective. Hence WG has added classes such as Deliveree, Deliverer, Originator, etc. When adding these classes the WG has reflected about the facts that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The information relative to which roles intervene in the eOrdering phase are normally specified as "Order Terms";</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the stage of eOrdering, the roles do not seem to carry very much information, however we foresee that the actions and other properties related to the agents playing those roles will emerge when "fulfilling" the Order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This reflection has led the WG to identify that we may be in front of two different types of reifications:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reification to specify "information", "terms" or "conditions" anounced by the buyer related to the ordering; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reification to describe "situations" related to the fulfilling of the order;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first case, some members of the WG proposed to name the reification "RolesAssignment", since in their opinion this is merely about to identify which roles play one specific (and only one) Agent, and nothing else. Other alternatives were suggested for the naming of this reification (Ordering, OrderingInformation, OrderingTerms even).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The discussion ends at this point (16:30), and the WG proposes to go on discussing on the Roles in the context of eOrdering.</p>

<p>The approach of the meeting was focused on the discussion of roles and subroles. The meeting started with the last decisions made on the 13th of October.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the discussion of the diagram the following decisions were made:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG decided to change ProcurementInvolvement by ProcurementSituation. This class is connecting the agent to a particular role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG the need or not to have the class PlannedProcurementPart within the generic diagram (see above). It comes from a previous analysis of when procurement is in the planning phase or whether it has been planned and design in terms of procedure, lots, etc,. When mapping ontology to eForms we needed to model the planning phase in the procurement. The WG concluded that this class is not needed in the diagram because in the end it will not exist and the class was removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The association property was changed because it should go from ProcurementSituation to Period and cardinality 0..1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed the involvesActivity (activity-type). For example, there is an awards contract activity and there are two roles, the buyer and the winner, so how to know that this activity is related to one of the roles. With a query, the activity and the role and agent performing that activity is retrieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generic class owl:Thing was removed after discussion with the WG. The specialisation of ProcurementSituation profile the situation, meaning by profile that extends and customises the situation. One customization could be the restriction of cardinality, and one example of example could that the AwardDecision needs to extend the subcontract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Buyer class was removed from the Award-Reification diagram and the property from AwardDecision to Winner was renamed by epo:hasWinner 0..1 instead of epo:involvesWinner. Also, the property AwardDecision involvesBuyer Buyer was removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bidirectional property from Subcontract to AwardDecision was modified. Instead to say AwardDecision epo:isReferredToIn Subcontract, and Subcontract epo:acceptsProposalOf AwardDecision, the direction was changed saying that AwardDecision epo:acceptsProposalOf Subcontract, and Subcontract epo:refersToAwardDecision AwarDecision. Moreover, the WG saw that already exist in the model that Subcontract refersToAwardResult AwardDecision, and AwardDecision has Subcontract. This property was removed since the bidirectional  property AwardDecision epo:acceptsProposalOf Subcontract, and Subcontract Subcontract epo:refersToAwardDecision AwarDecision means the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property from ContractAwardNotice to AwardDecsion was also changed to notifiesAwardDecision instead of notifiesAwardResult, and the multiplicity was changed from 1 to 1..*.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The property refersTo from ProcurementSituation to Lot was also removed.</p>

<p>The meeting ends with the discussion if the AwardDecsion is the reification class.</p>

<p>The WG making use of the diagrams created, continue the discussion on the usage of the reification class. The following decisions raised from the discussion were:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The definition of AwardDecision was not correct, since it applied to the whole process instead of to particular lot or lots. The origin of this previous (misleading) definition was that we tend to see the AwarDecision as a Document. We agreed that the class "epo:AwardDecision" is to be seen as a class (data), and this class will be linked to an AwardDecisionDocument (in the future - we will add this to the mid-long-term action point list).
The WG proposes to create 'labels' to identify issues related to 'award decision' and to 'mid-term action point' and 'long-term action point', so we do not forget addressing them timely. The minutes, too, should refer to issues particularly connected to, for example, 'award decision'. This would also allow the link, more effectively, to the diagrams and examples that contribute to explain and illustrate the issue and the decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new definition of AwardDecision reads, thus, as follows: "Resolution of the buyer as to the result of a given Lot.". This decision has the following implications for the design and implementation of the ontology:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recall that one procedure has always at least one Lot and may be divided into several Lots;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One object (individual) of the class AwardDecision will have to be instantiated per winning Organisation, its Role ("Winner"), the Lots awarded to this Organisation, possibly a contact point inside the winning Organisation, and the date of the awarding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This AwardDecision class becomes, as a matter of fact, a 'reification' class that is based on the more generic pattern already proposed for the linking of different concepts participating in a procurement situation. The AwardDecision will be then designed as a subclass of that other generic reification class;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generic reification class connects, by default, the following concepts:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>One Agent (and only one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Role (and only one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Lot (and only one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact Point (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Period (optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activity (codelist) (optional)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no need for involving the Procedure in the reification since this can be reached through the Lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OP explained that the role of Buyer is currently being approached inside the Commission (DG GROW + OP) as two different 'activities', thus the relevance of connecting the generic reification class to 'Activity', too. These two activities would be 'the buyer for this particular procedure' and the 'buyer for subsequent procedures resulting from this particular procedure'; (this is still an ongoing work within COM). The role buyer will be connected to one of these two codes via the predicate "isResponsibleFor';</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This makes it necessary to connect back again the Buyer role to the AwardDecision reification since the link between Procedure and Buyer will be removed as a consequence of having the 'responsibilities' of the buyer codified inside the codelist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pending task for the Working Group is to come up with a better name for the generic reification class: the term 'involvement' does not seem appropriate because not all agents are involved in a given reified situation (ASAP Action Point for the WG). This naming aspect affects also the predicates of the object properties linking the reification to its 'things'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagrams, examples, and queries to better understand the functioning of this approach can be found (here)[url] (through the issues workspace).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next steps related to the design and implementation of roles and subroles are:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finish reviewing the casuistry about Award Decision;</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Roles and Subroles</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG started the discussion with proposing some clarification examples from the discussion on the 6th of October. From the clarifications, The WG made a general question about how a business person could understand what is represented in the UML. The WG, as an example to understand this need, said that if we are doing a mapping we need to understand from the UML to what we are mapping. One possibility could be the addition of notes in the UML to explain what is represented in the diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the creation of a note in the eAward diagram to explain which roles are involved in the awarding process. This note could say that the award decision involves only 2 roles: 1. The buyer, the one that awards; 2. The winner, the one that is awarded. Moreover, everis indicated that in this note can be added a reference to a ppt with more details of the roles-taxonomy representation, for instance. The WG replied that the problem is that we will end with a lot of notes in different diagrams and what will happen when it is automatized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG also asked how the reification is helping in the eAward diagram. The reply was that the function of the reification is to link one agent/role with a specific activity. The WG thought that the reification is not needed in the AwardDecision and the AwardDecision could be considered as the reification. Everis indicated that the reification is needed because of the existence of the Agent and there are no other ways to know who is the agent/role/contact point behind the award decision. The WG did not see the need to have the reification in the AwardDecision diagram. There could be different winners in the decision 1 or 10, there is no problem, and the Buyer does not have other or more activities in the award decision. Everis said that if there is no reification and you want to instantiate the agent that wins the lot, to do that you need to have multiple instances of the winner and to see which instance is connected to one agent. The reification solves the problem to instantiate a role multiple times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conclusion and decision were that the reification will not point anymore to the taxonomy, it will point to the classes. The WG worked in such a solution, instead to have the class "AwardInvolvement" linked to the "role-taxonomy", now such class is linked to the winner through the property "involvesWinner". The discussion came from the need that the award decision/award involvement only involves 2 roles, the buyer and the winner. The buyer is not connected to the AwardInvolvement because it belongs to the responsibility of the procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: roles and subroles</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG started listing the topics inside the roles and subroles to be discussed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Which classes are to be removed and how these concepts end up in the model (e.g. Winner, Buyer are to be removed because we would have them as role codes in the role-taxonomy);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What shall we do with the attributes in those classes? E.g. WinnerRank, or the attributes of the class buyer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we need a reification class, or is the class “AwardDecission”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redundant properties between the classes representing Roles (v2.0.2)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG started with the discussion of the first bullet. The WG analyses the conceptual model and saw that the AwardDecision refers to Lot and also the EvaluationResult is connected to the AwardDecision, and then AwardDecision is referredBy a Contrac and the AwardDecision has a Winner. Moreover, the Buyer is connected to the AwardDecision who makes decisions in the AwardDecision:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO/tree/feature/frozen-2.0.2/implementation/test/doc/img/Award-Reification.jpg">Award Reification</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to this discussion, the WG identified examples of situations for the usage of the reification class. One first observation is that the action performed by the role is frequently (but not always) connected to a relevant entity of the ontology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example (1)the AwardDecision is connected to the AwardResult and is ‘made by the role Buyer’; (2)The Tender is connected to the agent that submits it, which in eProcurement we know it as ‘eSubmission’; (3)The contract, which is resulting from a situation involving the signatory parts; (4) Other situations that do not connect the agents to a result. For all these cases, the WG proposes to have a Generic Pattern Structure that can be specialized per situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The topic of whether the ontology should model processes was raised once again because the reifications of the type ProcurementInvolvement (e.g. eSubmission) look very much like processes. The WG checked that this is not the case for at least the only reification we have for the time being (AwardDecision).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG continued discussing what to do with the AwardDecision. For that purpose, it was presented and explained a diagram that contains a new reification class named “AwardInvolvement”, it is the class that connects the Agent, with the roles, with other classes. In this model, it is not possible to know who is the Agent that is performing something until we state what is the role and the type of Organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this discussion, the WG concluded that we need to find a good term for the reification(s), neither ‘ProcurementEvent’ nor ‘ProcurementInvolvement’ is good enough. In the case of AwardDecision, the involvement entails active participation (and the Winner does not participate in the decision-making). Moreover, in the generic case, the Event concept does cover many more aspects that were never intended to be represented in the ePO (processes, for example, and events in general).</p>

<li>
<p>SelectionCriterionType. Now the type of the criteria is in the class Criterion and the definition for the type is there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ThresholdValue. The WG discussed the need to rename this as "Threshold" and to remove the ThresholdValueType. Same actions should be replied in the AwardCriterion class. For this discussion, the WG check within the eForms mappings, how the ThresholdValue was used. The BT-7532 Selection Criteria Second Stage Invite Number Threshold was the concept used for the mapping to the ThresholdValue. The definition of this BT was also took into account by the WG for the creation of a new definition for the concept "Threshold". The WG created a document to understand what is a threshold, based also in the definition of the eForms BT-7532.</p>

<p>The WG discussed which is the best modelling approach if to have the FinancialOfferValue as an object property or as a class.</p>

<li>
<p>The WG asked if this class is needed for the eOrdering. The WG justified that it is not needed if in eOrdering we have the Value, then the FinancialOfferValue can be got from it.</p>

<li>
<p>The WG decision was to remove the class the FinancialOfferValue and to convert it into an object property as in v2.0.1 in the model</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Roles and Subroles</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG continued with the discussion of roles and subroles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG started the discussion mentioning that the solution proposed in the last meeting is very generic. For example, the WG was not completely convinced with the name "event" for the reification. The WG discussed alternatives of it, but previously we need to understand where we need data of organisations, activities, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG also indicates that the name "Event" is very generic object and the implications is that it can be used for anything in any situation.  In terms of querying, the WG indicates that the results on a query in a reification retrieves a lot of entities in the result since it is very generic. For the purpose to see different query results, the WG saw the need to define user stories to define competency questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After different points of discussions on how to model the roles and subroles, the WG agreed on the approach of the reification, codes and taxonomies, but also was identified the need of simplify the reification and use them only in a given a context with only those classes that need to be reified for that context. The WG agreed on the fact that the reification should be specialised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG, concerning the "ProcuremenEvent" class reification, decided as an action point to see which are the "events" that the ontology currently has.</p>

<p><strong>Topics of discussion: Roles and Subroles discussion</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everis prepared a presentation for the discussion of the new approach roles and subroles.
(<a href="_attachments/presentations/RolesTaxonomy_and_ProcurementEvents(WorkinProgress).pptx">Roles Taxonomy and Procurement Events</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everis explained how the roles and subroles are currently modelled. The current model of roles and subroles represents them as classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everis explained that as an alternative to the current model design of roles and subroles was to remove all the roles and subroles simplifying the ontology. The alternative solution is to use the reification taxonomy to represent the roles and subroles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everis explained that eu vocabularies have different codelists related to the role: "role", "organisation-subrole", "buyer-legal-type", "role nature" and "role qualifier".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another activity that everis did for the preparation of the new approach on how to model the roles and subroles was to review the "Organisations, Roles and Activities as per the Directives" model using a model created in previous analysis by OP</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/roles%20and%20subroles%20(1).png" alt="Roles and Subroles">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Based on the above model which depicts the different main activities of the contracting entity and the contracting authority, everis created a sample model on how to model the different activities performed by the tenderer, the winner, and the subcontractor:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/ativities%20tenderer.jpeg" alt="Activities and Tenderer">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everis explained and said that the model includes the main roles which are the Buyer, the Economic Operator, and the Procurement Manager (this is a temporary name until a new one will be agreed). Everis also indicated that the concept scheme of the model, which is representing a taxonomy, is the Role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the everis proposal about the activities, everis explained that the different activities will be taxonomies associated with the different top concepts (e.g. Economic Operator, Buer, Procurement Manager). However, everis explained that with this solution is difficult to query, and does not solve all the situations unless the activities are involved separately in the reification, which entails specific rules for the association between role and subrole-activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the exercises that everis performed is to try to model all the roles and subroles in taxonomy with the inclusion of the alignment to the Directives. The problem identified was that some elements will be repeated in taxonomy since for example the contracting authority and the contracting entity authority have the same types but they need to be represented separated in the taxonomy. Nonetheless, they will have different tags for their representation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding the "Procurement Manager" role, everis identified two types: "Procurement Service Provider" and "Central Purchasing Body". The WG indicates that the Central Purchasing Body was decided that it is a Buyer. Everis indicated that it is also modeled in the taxonomy as a buyer. The Central Purchasing Body plays the role of awarding and the role of managers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving on the presentation, everis introduced to the WG the reification proposal. The reification is a class that connects everything amongst itself. This reification connects the agent with the role and with a thing that is being affected by an activity performed by a role. The reification approach includes a "RoleTaxonomy" with all the roles and their activities:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/reification.jpeg" alt="Reification">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed then what to do with the attributes that are right now in the different role classes that will be removed if the reification approach is implemented. The WG asked why not to add the attributes in the reification. Everis indicated that then we will null the effect of the reification. The WG will discuss it later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG also discussed the name of the reification, the WG is not convinced at all with the name "ProcurementEvent".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning the "RoleTaxonomy", the WG said that the taxonomy is mixing the roles, subroles, activities, and functions in one single element. The WG proposed that maybe another possible solution is to have another taxonomy for the activities associated with the reification. Everis indicated that if we do that, we will need rules to ensure the association between role and subrole-activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everis presented to the WG different examples to show how the current model with roles and subroles as classes work and examples to show how the reification solution would work.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: eOrdering</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG created a new diagram named "eOrdering" for discussion of the phase. The following picture shows the classes added into the diagram:</p>

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/eOrdering.jpg" alt="eOrdering">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regarding the AdditionalDocument, the WG raised the need to discuss it because eOrdering is also a ProcurementDocument. The doubt is if the AdditionalDocument can be used also for Order. According to the ProcurementDocument definition, these documents are created for the Procedure by the Buyer (it is defined by the directive). Therefore an order cannot be considered as a Procurement Document as defined in the ontology and the Public Procurement Directives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG also said the eOrdering does not always start at the procedure level, they used quotation to define the tender. The WG said that this quotation could be the FinancialOfferValue class that already exists in the model. The definition of the FinancialOfferValue class has been changed: "Monetary amount for which the economic operators commits to fulfil a given request". The WG saw the need to have another class that aggregates financial offer values. Due to the different discussions, the WG proposed why not to start modelling Order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG explained that Order is the result of a tender, and this tender maybe a quotation. A new class named "Order" was created and which is a "Contract". The WG also said that Order has "OrderLines", there is a structured way to express what is bought. The WG created the class "Line" to represent the order line and also drop in the model the "Item" class because the order line defines Item. The Line class was connected to Order with the property "epo:hasLines". Also, the "Line" was associated with the "Item" through the property "epo:specifiesItem".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed the different Value classes existent in the model. The WG remember that there was a discussion where the decision was just to keep the Value class since the rest of the classes did not add many details. WG will check the previous version of the diagram to see how the Value was modelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG asked what is the meaning of the datatype "Amount", "Quantity", "Measure". Everis explained that these datatypes come from the UBL 2.3 standard. The definitions of the datatypes were added into the model.</p>

<p>The WG decided to remove the code usage from the selection criterion class (hasApplicability). Instead of this code list, the decision was to create an indicator as an attribute of the class selection criterion (UsageNotYetKnown).</p>

<li>
<p>The WG asked why the Procurement Criterion is used if there is a Criterion class in the core criterion and core evidence vocabulary (cccev). Everis and OP explained that as the cccev was under evolution, the decision was not to use the cccev and move all the classes to the epo namespace until there will be a stable version of the cccev. The WG also indicates that the ProcurementCriterion class is needed because some dependencies and properties are from the eProcurement domain and they cannot exist within the cccev.  Moreover, the WG argued that not only the selection and exclusion criteria are related to the Lot, the ESPD also relates the exclusion criteria to the Lot.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Participants: Working group members of eProcurement Ontology and TC 440</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TTC440 explains it was in the early process of establishing an eProcurement terminology  to be used by each specification that needed  a term. TC440 recognizes the eProcurement ontology and therefore their deliverables  intend to align with the eProcurement Ontology. This meeting aimst to set an organization that ensures this alignment. The proposed idea is to reuse the definitions developed by the eProcurement Ontology instead of creating a competing activity to establish a competing terminology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OP presents the eProcurement ontology. OP explains that the eProcurement ontology aims to cover the whole life cycle of the procurement from eNotification to eInvocing. Currently, the eProcurement ontology development is limited to the eNotification but this phase provides the backbone of information from the rest of the procurement phases. Presentlly the eProcurement ontology defines the terms and definitions of the data that is needed in the eNotification phase. A human-readable representation (a conceptual model) of the ontology depicting its concepts and how they interrelate has been created and it is publicly available for consultation.  Recently the team created the OWL and SHACL files that provide a machine-readable representation of the conceptual data model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OP  explains that the work produced for the ontology has been checked through the mapping to eForms, ensuring that the eForm business terms are mappable in the eProcurement Ontology. There is another project that is the mapping to the current TED forms. This work is not complete but should be finished by the end of this year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ontology is built on the eProcurement directives so its focus is European and B2G, even though B2B has been taken into account in the fact that the Buyer can be a business. The ontology uses ccts components. OP indicates that all the related information and files of the ontology are publicly available on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OP presents the roadmap. It started with producing the Glossary. The eNotification phase is planned to be finished by the end of 2020. Then the plan is to start the eAccess phase. OP indicates that the roadmap is presented in the following order but it can be changed according to different needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OP explains how to access the different files related to the eProcurement Ontology. OP also presents the HTML version of the conceptual model and the different diagrams that represent the ontology, and how the classes, code lists, and attributes of a class are represented in the model. OP shows an example of how the definition of a class and attribute is defined in the model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TC440 asks OP that if the Ontology is based on the directives it means that the Ontology is focused on public procurement. OP indicates that the Ontology is focused on public procurement, but it can be extended in a larger scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cécile Guasch explains the reasons for using the eProcurement Ontology and the rationale of the eProcurement Ontology:
1.	Reuse terms and models defined by the eProcurement Ontology (ensure that legislation is consistently taken into consideration,
the work done by the eProcurement Ontology working group is highly resource intensive);
2.	Adopt the same methodology (the activity started from a conceptual model which has been improved and updated with the working group);
3.	Feed the eProcurement Ontology (change request, new concept).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposal is that the WG from the different projects can take the current version of the model, the v2.0.2, which is being evolved and request to the eProcurement Ontology WG the extension or creation of definitions for some concepts.
The approach consists in the steps listed below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the information elements of CWA transaction specification that can be found in the eProcurement ontology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for coherence of meaning of the common subset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify gap and for the gap solve following 3 items:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Propose change requests to the eProcurement ontology:
To update existing elements of the ontology
To create new elements (concepts, property or attribute)</p>

<p>Propose specialization or extension of the eProcurement ontology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet with the eProcurement ontology to discuss the proposal to solve the gap and the Change requests</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Mappings TED forms - Standard Form 17 (Defence), section III.2 Conditions for participation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OP asked the business people, whether they could check in their respective countries if the conditions for participation are used as selection or exclusion criterion. OP indicates that this is a need found doing the mappings to the TED forms and it is not represented in the model due eForms is not going into this detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discussion about this topic was to use the “ProcurementCriterion” to instantiate these type of criteria. The WG detected a problem if the “ProcurementCriterion” is used because it is an abstract class and therefore querying the criteria the data retrieved will be from selection and exclusion criterion. Therefore, there is no way to differentiate it. The WG indicated that the conclusion was that the concept should be placed in exclusion criterion with a note that this is only used in the specific case of this standard form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Group of economic operators</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OP explained that in the TED forms mappings to the ePO Ontology there is the need to know how a tenderer is a group of economic operators. Currently, the mapping is through the property “isMemberOf”. The WG indicates that the correct mapping is thought the inheritance property therefore the mapping is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tenderer isA Economic Operator, Economic isA Role, EconomicOperator isRoleOf OrganisationGroup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OP also asked if the address to be provided is the address of the group or the address of each member. The WG check the form and said that the address of each member is the one to be provided, then how it is possible to know that it pertains to the same group. The WG explained that as the contract number is repeatable in the form but can only be awarded to one winner, whilst different winners (as in FrameworkAgreement) should have different ContractNumbers. When the Contractor is repeated it means that it belongs to the same winner (as in a Consortium).</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion: Values of the subcontract parts</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OP commented that in the lasts working group meetings there were some discussions about the value of every subcontract part of the TenderLot and how to represent the total value subcontracted. In one of the discussions, the decision was to add the total value subcontracted as an attribute of the Statistical Information class. However, in the other discussion, the decision was to remove the attribute from the StatisticalInformation and to add a new definition in the property “hasEstimatedValue” which links subcontract and value. OP, indicates that this second solution does not solve the problem because then with that definition is not possible to know the estimated value of a single subcontract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG agreed on the OP statement and the decision was to add the attribute “TotalValueSubcontracted” in the StatisticalInformation class. Now, the statistical information subcontract value is the aggregation of the different values subcontracted. Moreover, the WG indicates that a business is needed to verify that the total value subcontracted is exactly the sum of the different subcontracted parts. As a matter of fact, all the data in the statistical information needs to be verified against the particular data held by the model.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<p>OP asked the business people, whether this is Exclusion, Selection criteria, both or what and whether this should go to the ESPD or in the Procurement Documents.
The WG decided to use the “ProcurementCriterion” to instantiate these type of criteria, instead of using the Exclusion or Selection criteria classes. In this way, it is possible to map the current Forms to the Ontology.</p>

For the pilot, it was needed to know who is responsible for a procedure. The Central Purchasing Body can be responsible of the procedure and the model until today&#8217;s meeting did not reflect this clearly.
Before the modification the CPB actAs Buyer and is responsibleOf the procedure. The discussion went around the need to add or not the object property responsibleOf also between CPB and Procedure.</p>

<p><strong>JointProcurement discussion:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main question was how to express the leader of the procedure when it is a JointProcurement.
To have a consistent representation of the organisation roles in the case of Joint Procurement it was agreed to have role for the different organisations involved in an “OrganisationGroup”. Thus, the Group-member role was included in the epo:organisation-subrole code list.
Then Group Leader and Group Member are the expected roles for organisations within an “OrganisationGroup”.</p>

<p><strong>FrameworkAgreementTechnique Discussion</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discussion started with whether a lot uses frameworkAgreementTechnique in a frameworkAgreement.
As the FrameworkAgreement establishes a Technique then a FrameworkAgreementTechnique is ConcludedBy a FrameworAgreement. The inverse property was missing in the model.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of Discussion:</strong> Pending Actions from the mappings of the current TED forms / Definitions</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both meetings were focused on the discussion of pending action points that arose from the mappings of the current TED forms to the ePO Ontology.  The pending actions and the discussions were the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>SubmissionTerm Deadline to change the definition of the attribute.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The class Submission Term was revised and the attributes were made generic to allow the representation of the different Document Types (Tender, Request to Participate, etc)`</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The definitions of the attributes were changed accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>epo:DeadlineRequestToParticipate: DateTime has been removed as it is represented by the epo:ReceiptDeadline DateTime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To discuss with the WG if the Lot epo:hasContractEstimatedDuration should be ContractEstimatedDuration or ContractDuration.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the mapping of eFoms the attribute hasContractEstimatedDuration Period is only applied to Contract Modification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be hasEstimatedContractDuration Period for CN and PIN CFC. Other PINs and CAN and Contract modification require further analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the mapping which arose the discussion, F2-2.2.7 Should be Lot hasContractDuration Period</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To discuss "How do you account for when a TenderLot has more than one subcontract" (Form 03)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It should be done through Statistical Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By adding TotalSubcontractedValue and the TotalSubcontractedShare to the Class "StatisticalInformation".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also to be checked the mappings in eForms to see whether it was well addressed in the eForms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion Notice on a Buyer Profile.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG saw that Notice in a Buyer Profile is a type of PIN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore it should be connected to other PIN or Notices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG saw that Document Diagram contains two classes, the first one defining eForms big phases and a second one which contains more granularity “epo:notification-phases-types” (Planning.pin, Competition.pin, etc). However the WG had missed a third more granular level, taking into account the sub-sub-types specified in eForms such as Planning.Pin.BuyerProfile, Planning.PIN.TimeReduction, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional Topics:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG stated the need to check out the relationships between Notice, Document, and Procedure. “notifies” “announces” and “relatesTo” seem to have many domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"notifies" has three domains: PIN, Document, and Notice. And also three ranges: Procedure, PlannedProcurementPart, and CallForCompetition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG proposed to remove "announces" between Document and Procedure, and to add it between Notice and Procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion</strong>: Pending Actions from the mappings of the current TED forms</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach of 4 meetings was focused in the different actions points came up from the mappings of the current TED forms to the ePO Ontology. The pending actions and the discussions were the following ones:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Values with VAT or without VAT</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to the current TED forms all the values are without VAT. However in the ontology that differentiation is not properly modelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently the ontology has three different types of values "Financial Offer Value", "Procurement Value" and "Value". According to latest discussions the WG asked why these three classes are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everis presented a new version of the diagram which only includes the class Value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everis proposed to create a new codelist which will list different type of taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG reviewed the attributes of value, they considered a description attribute for the "OtherCharges".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG decided to do the financial Offer value as a property that links the "TenderLot" with "Value".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To discuss with the WG if epo:hasEstimatedTenderInvitationDate Date should be at the Lot Level. Also the DPS termination (in Procedure we have “CompetitionTermination” and according to its definition it is the same as the “DPSTermination”).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG decided whether the EstimatedTender… should be at lot level and not procedure level. The WG agreed and then in the ontology we have to include it in the Extension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning the DPS (in Procedure we have “CompetitionTermination” and according to its definition it is the same as the “DPSTermination”), we have changed the definition of the CompetitionTermination attribute: No further contracts will be awarded in this procedure.
Additional Information: PIN for Competition needs to be signaled. This field can be used even if no contracts are awarded in the contract award notice.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG decided to remove the note in the DPS termination class.</p>
</li>

The proposal is to have a Consortium class in order to be aligned with the W3C Organization ontology. In the W3C ontology Consortium is equal to CollaborationOrganization. However, we can extend the class with our own name that could be "Consortium". The WG agreed.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion</strong>: Roles and Subroles</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everis presented, as an action point assigned to them, another solution on how to map the roles and subroles without having the subroles as properties and also an example to check whether the model based on properties for the subroles works or not. Everis explained that the current solution works and showed to the WG a query example to confirm it. However, this solution needs more works around and everis is proposing to have a reification as a better solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG also discussed whether the different subroles should be linked to the Agent and not to the Role. The WG also said that if the different subroles are linked to the Agent, we will not know if the subroles is executed by a Buyer or an Economic Operator, for example. The WG said that this always will happen and maybe the best solution will be to have a reification with a taxonomy for the subroles, but rules will need to be defined to control the relationships. The WG still need to discuss further on the different solutions proposed. The WG agreed that the current solution solves the problems for the TED mappings, but the solution difficult to maintain the coherence between the roles and subroles.</p>

<p>Everis expressed its concerns with the temporary solution. Everis indicated that with this solution the same properties have been created for the different roles which complicates the model. Moreover, some disjointness needs to be included in order to say when to use one property or the other one. The WG agrees that the many properties  complicates the understand-ability of the model. However, as there is an urgency with the TED mappings for the pilot project the WG agreed to go with this approach, but to make clear that this is a temporary solution. The WG also asked if the temporary solution works. One action point was assigned to everis to provide to the WG an rdf example to see if the model works.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion</strong>: Roles and Subroles</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The meeting was focused on the everis presentation on how to model the roles and subroles in the ontology. Everis created a presentation (<a href="_attachments/presentations/Everis_Roles&amp;Subroles.pptx">Roles and Subroles</a>) to gather different possibilities on how to model the roles and subroles. The Everis proposal is to create a reification that allows to link the roles and subroles with Lots. A reification is the ability to treat a Statement as a Resource , and hence to make assertions about that statement. A statement may be reified as many different resources, allowing different manifestations (“statings”) of that statement to be treated differently if required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the presentation of the everis solution, the WG said that the solution lacks the relationship between the Agent and the new reification class. Everis did not agree because in the end the class agent is a metaclass, and therefore a Role is at the end an agent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everis also presented an example in RDF to show how the roles and subroles model should be solved. The WG asked that according to the RDF presented, how the users will know that the Agent is uniquely identified by a role. The WG thoughts that the Agent needs to be linked to the reification. The WG also discussed whether the contact point should be linked or not to the role and agent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed the name of the reification class. The proposed name is "ProcedureRoleActivity". The WG says "ProcedureInvolvement".

<p>Some other discussions were:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is needed to remove the link between role and contract point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reification needs to link Agent, role, subrole, lot, and contact point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the everis proposal is not enough clear and needs more discussion, the WG decided to create a temporary solution that is based in to create the subroles as properties that link the different roles to the Lot.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion</strong>: Roles and Subroles</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OP explains the need to change the roles and subroles due to the mappings of the current TED forms to the eProcurement Ontology. The OP explains that as the model is now, it is not possible to know which subrole (e.g. recipient, execution of the payment, etc.) is playing a role and its participation in a Lot. For that purpose, Giorgia Lodi explained a couple of examples created to solve the situation. After the explanation of the examples, the WG continued discussing and trying to solve the problem with the usage of examples. The following presentation captures some of the possible solutions to the problem. However, the WG did not arrive at an agreement and everis will propose a solution for the next 25th of June.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion:</strong> Roles and Functions</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed a new way on how to model the different roles. Currently, the way to do it is through the class “Function” which is linked to the Agent. This class has a dependency on a codelist named “function-taxonomy” which indicates the function that for example, an organization is executing. The problem identified was that different functions are grouped in the same list and it is very difficult to distinguish which one is executed by an Organisation or by a Buyer for instance. Moreover, some functions can only be executed by one specific role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to propose a new way of modelling the roles and functions, a presentation with a new proposal was created and discussed. The WG agreed on the new way and it will be implemented in the model. This presentation (<a href="_attachments/presentations/Roles%20subroles%20and%20Regulatory%20Framework%20Providers.pptx">Roles, Subroles and Regulatory Framework Providers</a>) gathers the final decision, excluding the Evaluator that also needs to be added as a role.

<p><strong>Topic of discussion:</strong> Procurement Documents Access</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During both meetings the WG discussed whether there was a need to have the class Access Terms to indicate the  access to some parts of the restricted procurement documents. The WG discussed creating a new class named DocumentCollection whereby all the procurement documents could belong to a collection. This class would have two properties that link the Document collection to the Channel. One of the two would be the property for the restricted access of the Procurement Documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed the sense to have the Document Collection class or not. The WG also noted that the goal of this class was to remove the relations from an individual document. For that purpose, the WG worked on an example in order to see the differences between a Document and a Document Collection, and if this last one is really necessary. See here the example <a href="_attachments/presentations/DocumentCollection.pptx">Document Collection</a>. After the discussing example the WG saw that the DocumentCollection class creates complexity and  is not needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, and to detail the discussions that took place in both meetings, the following points were discussed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WG discussed whether the Access Term and landing page are needed. The WG said that it is needed however some of its attributes should be moved to Procedure (e.g. Additional information deadline should go to Procedure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing page is a webpage to indicate where you can find all the documents, and inside you have all documents URLs. This landing page can be always applied to a procurement document.</p>

<p>The WG started the meeting with the discussion of the epo:RectrictedCommunicationJustification which is an attribute of the class Document. The WG analysed where this restriction is used in other classes. For that purpose, the eForms mapping was checked and the epo:RestrictedCommunicationJustification was also used in the AccessTerms.
The WG discussed which is the meaning of the AccessTerms and whether these terms should be linked to the Documents since they refer to conditions and stipulations about where and how to access the procurement documents. The only association in the ontology between the AccessTerms and the Documents is through the class Channel. The WG said that through the AccessTerms the only Documents that can be consulted are the restricted ones, but they asked how the full Documents that not restricted can be consulted. For that purpose, the WG made an exercise, through a real case, to see how the model should be. After this exercise the following modelling actions took place:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the AccessTerm class SomeProcurementDocumentsRestrictedJustification the datatype was changed from Text to Code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the AccesTerms class a new attribute was created ProcurementDocumentLandignPage. This attribute means the internet address for accessing unrestricted procurement documents and replaces the property epo:hasDownloadURL that linked AccessTerms and Channel.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"<em>This is the legal form of an agent when it plays the role of the buyer. The reason why this classification is associated to the buyer and not to the agent is that these categories are included in the procurement legislation and to avoid the misunderstanding that these categories define the legal nature of the organisation.

</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p>epo:MainActivityType. This attribute was moved to the "Organisation" class since a Buyer that is a role can be the role of an Organisation.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of Discussion:</strong> Buyer Profile</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this meeting, the WG discussed whether the Buyer Profile was needed or if it could be replaced by another existing class. In the course of this discussion the following exchange of ideas were debate:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to the model, a Buyer has a Buyer Profile which is a "Website address where the buyer publishes information on its procurement procedures and general information.". According to this definition, the WG saw clearly that a Buyer Profile is a Channel. With that proposal, the Buyer which is a role and plays the role of an Agent and the Buyer uses the Buyer Profile, which is a Channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The  WG proposed that there is no need to have a URL attribute for the Buyer Profile since the Channel already has a URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WG proposed to link the channel and the agent through the property "ownedBy". The WG was inspired by the Core Public Service Vocabulary. This property has to be understood as who is the responsible of the channel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG after a long discussion agreed on the following decisions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep buyer profile which is a Channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use the buyer profile at the Notification time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a discussion on the property "ownedBy" the WG decided to keep and added a definition to clarify what OwnedBy means.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of Discussion: Evaluation Method Type</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed the need of whether it is correct to have a code list with pass, fail, weighted. OP explained that the other day there was a discussion where the PASS-FAIL topic was discussed. In this meeting it was suggested contrary to some participants understanding that a tenderer does not have to pass all selection criterion first, a weighting was used to see who passed or fail otherwise there would always need to be  a minimal value for the criterion.  During the aforementioned meeting it was decided to ask implementers in the ontology group of their thoughts. The opinion in the WG was that a criterion needed to pass the selection criterion first, and the second step in a multi-stage procedure was to apply the weightings to see which economic operators could proceed to the award phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a conclusion of the discussion the WG decided that, for the time being, it does not affect the ontology at this point in time and that the discussion should be passed back for discussion in the ESPD.  Marc Christopher agreed to seek a legal opinion on the situation.</p>

<p><strong>Topic of discussion:</strong>  Buyer</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed the issue "topic of discussion" that was created in GitHub and commented. For more details see <a href="https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/237" class="bare">https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/issues/237</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this issue was reflected the discussion that took place in the last meeting. According to Jachym’s reply is possible that Buyer has activities in the Public Sector and Private Sector at the same time. Taking into account this response the WG said that if it is needed to know if the buyer has another activity that is not the one specified in the code list main-activity or other main activity the following ideas were proposed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>to call the code list “other main activities” as "NACE".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the property linking the Buyer to the code was named “hasEntityActivity”.  Additionally, the WG discussed the need to have two attributes, one for the mainactivity code and the other one for the NACE code. According to the disjointness, this is not possible, we should have just one and then the user selects which code is used. The final decision was to have these two codes and the same predicate with a disjoint to both codes, or the main activity is one or the other one. The attribute in the Buyer class for the codes was named "MainActivityType" code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concerning to the attribute in the Buyer class named "OtherActivityDescription", the WG decidedd to rename it “ActivityDescription” and the following note of when this should be used was added in the model:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>“In the ePO ontology a taxonomy with all activities, based on different classifications (COFOG, UTILITIES, NACE), will be provided. In ePO, this element is to be used exclusively to complement the definition attached to the MainActivityCode.
However, in eForms, there is the code "other" to cover undefined activities. For mapping to this eForms feature, one could also use this property.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Action Points: </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TR: Provide an example of where a buyer would have difficulty choosing from the codes in the main activity table and where it would be advantageous to use the NACE code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach of the meeting on the 30th January was focused on the continuation of the discussion of the everis’ proposal regarding the “Agent” class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everis and OP shared with the WG a copy of the old and new Buyer version as well as a view of the agent diagram that it is suggested to replace the organisation diagram, along with the organisation diagram. The WG used the occasion to discuss the email sent by Georgia regarding the usage of “Agent” and/or the “Organisation” classes and some doubts raised up after her analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG proposes to have a base class that inherits from Agent which represent the legal status. This coul be a legal entity since att the end a legal entity can be an organization. However, in ePO we need to represent also a system and therefore it can not be considered a Legal entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG discussed what is a “ProcurementServiceProvider”. The WG said that a good example of it is an eSender and it can act on behalf of Buyer. This clarification raised up a discussion about the usage of “role” properties. The WG explained that we did not focus on processes during the development of the ontology and we did not use roles. Now the problem is what happens when a buyer is an agent. In order to solve this problem, everis proposed to use the property "isA" instead of to use "Role". Moreover, another proposed solution was to create a role class that could act as the role of the buyer, and therefore, there is no need to use the property role. The WG created a new diagram to reflect the different possible solutions proposed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the reflection, the WG decided to create the new class “Role” which is an abstract class. In addition, it was point out that an abstract class organisation role was needed between the different classes ie “buyer” and “agent” to allow an organisation in different cases to be either buyer or economic operator without having to have its information introduced twice and therefore leaving open the opportunity for error conflicting information.However, this approach is still under discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach of the meeting on the 28th January was focused on the everis’ presentation regarding the “Planning” mappings and the “Agent” class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everis started the meeting explaining its proposal for Planning. Everis explained that the problem discovered doing the mappings to eForms is that some classes cannot be mapped through the PlannedProcurementPart class and therefore the mapping goes through the Procedure in order to arrive to the Lot. A disjoint has been added between the property that links the PIN with the Procedure and the property that links the PIN with the PlannedProcurementPart. Regarding these possible options of the mappings (through the PlannedProcurementPart or Procedure) the WG worked in the following rule in order to know when to go from one or from the other one:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In PIN Time-limit the Notice will contain a reference either to PlannedProcurementPart or conversely to Procedure (both are disjoint, see also the diagram Planning). This implies that for PIN Time-limit it is necessary first to discern the existence of one of these classes to know how to get to specific information. For example, some ContractTerms properties like PlaceOfPerformance could be reached either starting from PlannedProcurementPart or through the Lots linked to the Procedure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the Planning mapping proposal was approved by the WG, the second half of the meeting was focused on the everis presentation of the usage of “agent” class instead of the “organization” class.
Everis explained that we need to have an “agent” class in ePO which should be an extension of an Agent class of a Core Agent Vocabulary from SEMIC. Everis explained that this Core vocabulary does not exist yet, but as everis is now contractor of SEMIC for the maintenance and evolution of some core vocabularies, they want to propose it. Everis explained that this new vocabulary is needed since the FOAF one does not allow proper reuse for ePO. The FOAF Agent class does not have a very good level of granularity in terms of properties and therefore a new Agent vocabulary would extend the FOAF agent class with more properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everis explained that they are proposing to use the Agent class instead of the organization because in ePO there is the need to represents not only Organizations, also Persons and systems. This proposition was more or less approved by the WG, however, they need that everis shares an example where the class Organization was used in the past and where the Agent class is used now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Action Points: </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>@everis: add a WG comment each time a PIN Time Limit  has 2 options this needs to be reflected also in the discussion maybe show the comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@everis: use of the INSPIRE directive for addresses in order to know how to use the Location class and how to improve the Address adding attributes from UBL, the same as SEMIC is doing in its Core Vocabularies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@everis: check the mappings and put in black the mappings that come from “Competition” and therefore were already reviewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@everis: Compare contact point and the communication channel, and think how the Electronic can be treated as a contact a point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@everis: think about the stereotypes used in the Organization model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>@everis: Share with the WG the comparison between the usage of the class Organization (old diagram) and the class Agent (new proposal)</p>

<p>The WG worked on the definition of the Voluntary Ex-ante Transparency Notice:
Voluntary Ex-ante Transparency Notice: A notice informing of the intention to award  a contract without prior publication of a contract notice.
Additional Information:
For European notices above the threshold
"A means of advertising the intention to award the contract without opening it up to formal competition. A contracting authority may decide that a contract does not require prior publication through a contract notice in the O.J.E.U. A reason for this decision may be that the contract meets the exceptional conditions described in Article 31 of Directive 2004/18/EC. In a recent V.E.A.T notice the reason was listed as “extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the contracting entity and in accordance with the strict conditions stated in the Directive” .
"Voluntary Ex-Ante Transparency Notice" (VEAT) where a contracting authority deems that a contract does not require prior publication of a contract notice in the European Journal (OJEU). This may apply, for example, if the contract meets the exceptional conditions justifying direct award of contracts.</p>
