Steps to generate the GC files out from the ESPD-EDM Code Lists excel file:

1. Open the file "https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/3.0.1/ESPD-EDM/__ESPDTeam__/ESPD-CodeLists.xlsx"
2. Save it locally as "ESPD-CodeLists.xml" (Select the following filetype: XML Spreadsheet)
3. Use your preferred XLS-T transformation method and the Stylesheet "excel-to-gc-multilang-v1.0.xsl" as an input to generate the *.gc files (each tab in "ESPD-CodeLists.xlsx" will be transformed into a separate *.gc file)
