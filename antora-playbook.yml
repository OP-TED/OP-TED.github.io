    ### Component's Latest Version
    #
    # We want to know the latest version of each component so we can create a redirect for the latest version.
    # Such a redirect would be useful for users that want to bookmark a link to the latest documentation for a component.
    # For example, we would be able to provide a link of the form: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest.  
    # It is also nice to be able to indicate a component's version in the main navigation panel (modules/ROOT/nav.adoc).
    #
    # However, we do not currently have any other way to determine the latest version of a component outside a page in the component itself.
    # So, as a workaround, we store the latest version of each component in these site-wide asciidoc attributes.
    # The downside is that we have to update these attributes whenever we release a new version of a component.
