<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Publications Office (OP) has developed a range of applications for the collection, validation, processing, visualisation and dissemination of eForms notices. These applications are collectively known as "TED Apps for eForms" and went into production use on 14 November 2022.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have prepared an additional "Preview" environment for eSenders and stakeholders, where we deploy releases of the TED Apps for eForms as they become available. This environment allows access to the applications before they are deployed in Production, and provides a testing environment that is closely aligned with production, but with no guarantee of features, data or availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users should consider that there is a limit to the capacity of the Preview systems, and they should not submit excessive volumes of notices while testing; the systems currently can handle around 5000 notices per day with no disruption, shared between all eSenders. See our <a href="https://enotices2.preview.ted.europa.eu/cookies-legal-notice">Terms of service for TED publishing services</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application features, URLs as well as the data present in the "Preview" environment, are subject to unannounced changes.</p>

URLs and API keys in "Production" and "Preview" environments are not interchangeable.

<dt class="hdlist1">TED eNotices2</dt>
<dd>
<p>eNotices2 is the reception system for eForms. Notices can be submitted and managed through the web front-end or via the TED API. eNotices2 replaces the current eNotices and eSentool applications. eNotices2 calls the Central Validation Service to validate submitted notices before sending them to TED Monitor for processing and publication.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">TED Central Validation Service</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Central Validation Service (also known as TED CVS) provides an API for validating eForms notices. It is called by eNotices2 to check the validity of a submitted notice, but it can also be called by eSender applications to validate a notice at any time.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">TED Viewer</dt>
<dd>
<p>Also known as "TED Viewer 2022" this notice visualisation service provides an API that allows applications to render an eForms notice in the HTML or PDF format.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">TED Developer Portal</dt>
<dd>
<p>The TED Developer Portal is envisioned to be a central hub for TED developer services. At this point in time, the portal allows eSenders to sign-up and obtain/manage their API key which is required for calling TED APIs.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">TED Monitor</dt>
<dd>
<p>Also known as "TED Monitor 2022", this application is the internal production system used by OP to prepare the publication in the Supplement of the Official Journal (hosted in the TED website) of the public procurement notices submitted every day. It also allows OP to check the lawfulness of certain notices and to mask unpublished fields.</p>

<p>In this version, the application is expected to allow users to create the 40 eForms notice types plus the 5 other notice types which include the 2 transport regulation notices, the European economic interest grouping and European company/cooperative registration forms, and the call for expression of interest. The fields which are available, along with their behaviour, are consistent with SDK versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8. SDK version 1.8 is supported in Preview environment as of 1 August 2023.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Production environment, SDK version 1.8 is supported as of 9 August 2023.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the codelist fields, prefilling of values is supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users can see the validation returned from CVS and have their notices rendered in HTML and PDF.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can create a Change notice or continue a procedure on a published notice, bear in mind that submitted notices go through another workflow in TED Monitor before they can be published, which takes place every working day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application also allows users to act upon notices and procedures, archiving, renaming and transferring them to other users or other procedures as well as export notices in XML.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also a search feature which allows users to sort through long lists of procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users can create workgroups between themselves and test the definitions of roles and permissions within these workgroups. They can also work and submit notices worked upon collectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users can define personalised settings for the legal basis and notice types that they want to use, as well as default languages in the notice, and tailoring of some fields is available:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optional fields can be set to mandatory or hidden, however, please note that we have removed the Conditional rules as of SDK 1.3 – please leave the default behaviour of the fields, otherwise conditional mandatory fields won&#8217;t be displayed in newly created notices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidential fields can be set to be always confidential or non-confidential.</p>
</li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the notice sections a search feature has been added and pagination for up to 2000 lots is supported.</p>

<p>As of SDK version 1.6, the lot distribution for lot groups has changed; there is a new section for that in the procedure.</p>

<p>Some validation errors are currently displayed as a pop-up window, without pointing to the error location. Please set a default currency to avoid validation errors in the notices created in the user interface that can lead to a message that the: “notice is probably incomplete”.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the moment, CVS validation does not work dynamically, i.e. there is no check between notices. This has implications, e.g. for checking notices of the same procedure or the same UUID v4 and different version ID; currently, it is possible to submit and publish two notices that carry the same notice ID and different version IDs. See in contrast: <a href="https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/schema/notice-information.html#noticeIDSection" class="bare">https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/schema/notice-information.html#noticeIDSection</a>.</p>

<p>Notices created before 15 March 2023 in Preview or Production environments and updated to SDK 1.6 may have issues.

<p>Each TPO (Touchpoint) should be assigned a role; users may have to remove TPOs from the notice if there are not enough roles to fill. In particular, for notice subtypes 1 to 3, no roles can be assigned to Touchpoints at the moment, meaning that all touchpoints should be removed from the notice.</p>

<p>The eNotices2 API URLs and parameters will change in later releases. The <a href="https://enotices2.preview.ted.europa.eu/esenders/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> provides basic documentation of the four functions.</p>

<p>Please note that the HTTP responses are still a work in progress; in certain cases, error code 500 is returned instead of 400. We are in the process of identifying these cases and correcting the responses and their corresponding messages to clearly indicate that the error is on client side and not on the server side. For instance, an error code 400 would mean that the notice is rejected by eNotices2 API and does not even get validated by CVS. In this case, the instance/ notice cannot be created in eNotices2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, "stop publication" on a submitted notice will return error code in certain cases, i.e when the notice is being processed and ready to be published. The process will be simplified in the future with the introduction of status “PUBLISHING”, which will forbid stopping publication of a notice of this status.

The Preview environment is for testing purposes; new SDK releases will first be made available on Preview before deployment in Production. Please note, however, that Preview only simulates Production and notices submitted in Preview are not published in a test environment of TED. “Published” is only a mock status that is automatically assigned to submitted notices at around 15:00 CET when they enter the export (notices are not actually published on TED). If there is a preferred publication date, Preview will show status “published” as soon as the export finishes, which is the previous working day at around 15:00 CET. As an example, if the preferred publication date falls on a Monday, the status will change to "published" the previous Friday at around 15:00 CET, when the export takes place (provided Friday is not a public holiday).

Notices submitted in Preview are only checked for lawfulness upon request. Please note that the lawfulness feature is activated in Preview as of 24 May 2023; this means that any notices submitted in Preview that trigger a lawfulness warning will remain in status "submitted" unless we receive your request to manually reject it. The feature has been activated so that eSenders can test the status "NOT_PUBLISHED" that a notice will receive when manually rejected by OP. Precondition for this is that the notice triggers lawfulness warning and we receive your request to reject it by business ID (i.e. notice ID + version ID).

In Production (live environment), the actual export to TED happens on workdays around 16:00 CET depending on the number of notices to be published in the next OJ S. When this process is initiated and a submitted notice is in the daily export, it will be published on TED at 09:00 CET in the next available OJ S based on the release calendar. Its status will then change to “Published”. Please note that stopping publication of a notice is not allowed at this stage, i.e. between the export and publication. In the Preview environment, the notice is only in Publishing status for a few seconds because there is a mock process to imitate publishing on TED. In Production, the notice will be in "Publishing" status between the daily afternoon export and publication on TED the next morning (working days). We will later introduce the status “Publishing” for such cases to avoid confusion. For more information on notice statuses, please see the eForms FAQ.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are currently in the process of providing more guidance for users of the eNotices2 web interface. Until we can provide some more guidance and until known issues are fixed and more rules are re-enforced, we have provisionally gathered here some tips to help users with avoiding validation errors:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In multi-stage procedures (BT-105), the second stage indicator should be set to 'yes' on one of those 3 groups where the criterion is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please avoid using the section “Information about late submission” except for the mandatory fields and the “Description of the NDA”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any date field which has a time attached must always have a value in the time field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Contract notices of the Defence directive, BT-71-Lot should not be filled in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For structured organisations, to get started, please fill in Organisation Name, Organisation Identifier and Oganisation Part Name under My Form Settings &gt; Main Buyer Settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no need to remove any preset values from the form-filling tool; if necessary, please complete any associated fields as you would normally. If there is no need to complete any associated fields, please ignore the preset values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tips_for_esenders"><a class="anchor" href="#_tips_for_esenders"></a>Tips for eSenders</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are an eSender, please note that the concept of Workgroups is reserved for users of eNotices2 web User Interface (UI). eSenders/ users of eNotices2 API       can still create workgroups in the UI of eNotices2 but the API is not aware of the context of workgroups, i.e. no API function can be performed on a notice           that has been manually transferred to the context of a Workgroup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eSenders should only use the API for the submission of notices and refrain from using the User Interface of eNotices2 for this purpose. The output of eNotices2 is not intended to reflect the correct format of notices submitted via API. Likewise, eSenders should not continue a procedure or create a Change notice via the User Interface for a parent notice that was originally sent via the API, and should not use the UI to manage or to import/export notices submitted via API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid authorisation issues when using eNotices2 API, make sure you generate your API key in the corresponding environment of the TED Developer Portal:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.preview.ted.europa.eu/home">Developer Portal in Preview</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To avoid authorisation issues when using eNotices2 API, log in at least once in the corresponding environment of the User Interface to pair your API key with your eNotices2 account and make sure that you perform at least one valid API request with your key to eNotices2 API:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://enotices2.preview.ted.europa.eu/home">eNotices2 in Preview</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>eNotices2 API supports currently SDK versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8. SDK version 1.8 is supported in Preview environment as of 1 August 2023 and in Production as of 9 August 2023. For the value to indicate in the cbc:CustomizationID element, it should always have the format "eforms-sdk-major.minor".  See this page for more details:
<a href="https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/versioning.html#_significance_of_the_sdk_version_in_notice_handling_and_validation" class="bare">https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/versioning.html#_significance_of_the_sdk_version_in_notice_handling_and_validation</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic rules that check between notices are not yet in place, users, however, should still respect the workflow of eForms notices. For instance, users may currently be able to submit a Change notice that refers to a parent notice that has not been yet published. The notice will still be blocked by our internal system (will enter in error). Currently, it is not possible to stop the publication of a notice that has entered in error in the Preview environment, but we are seeing what could be improved for these situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, there are some checks performed by eNotices2 API upon submission of a notice, e.g. eNotices2 will check (and reject) a notice with the same id and version id if it already exists in the system. In the future, such checks will be performed by CVS.</p>
