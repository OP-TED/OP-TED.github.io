Steps to generate the GC files out from the ESPD-EDM Code Lists excel file:

1. Open the file "https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V02.00.01.xlsx"
2. Save it locally as "ESPD-CodeLists-V02.00.01.xml"
3. Use your preferred XLS-T transformation method and the Stylesheet "Excel_to_GC_Multilang_v1.0.xsl" as an input to generate the *.gc files (each tab in "ESPD-CodeLists-V02.00.01.xlsx" will be transformed into a separate *.gc file)
