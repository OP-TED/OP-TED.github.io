<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public procurement represents around the 20% of GDP in Europe. This big buying volume offers a high economic potential to enhance efficiency of European procurement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EU is investing significantly on the digitalisation of the public procurement process (referred to as e-Procurement). This goes beyond simply moving to electronic tools; it rethinks various pre-award and post-award phases with the aim of makng them simpler for businesses to participate in, and for the public sector to manage. It also allows for the integration of data-based approaches at various stages of the procurement process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With e-Procurement, public spending should become more transparent, evidence-oriented, optimised, streamlined and integrated with market conditions. More specifically, e-Procurement offers a range of benefits such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>significant savings for all parties, both businesses and the public sector;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>simplified and shortened processes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reductions in red-tape and administrative burdens;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increased transparency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>greater innovation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>new business opportunities by improving the access of all enterprises, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to public procurement markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To deliver the aforementioned benefits, e-Procurement relies heavily on the exchange of data between the different systems supporting the procurement processes i.e., achieving end-to-end interoperability of public procurement processes and underlying systems, and on the availability and dissemination of procurement data to the wider public i.e., improving transparency and stimulating innovation and new business opportunities.</p>

<p>As stated in the Commission Regulation 2015/1986 (EU), contracting authorities in the EU are legally required to publish notices above certain capital thresholds. Article 6 of that Regulation states that either the online eNotices application or the TED eSender systems should be used for electronic transmition of notices to the Publications Office of the European Union. From a different angle, the implementation of the/ a revised PSI directive across the EU is calling for open, unobstructed access to public data to improve transparency, and to boost innovation, via the reuse of public data. Procurement data has been identified as data with a high-reuse potential. Making this data available in machine-readable formats, following on from the "data as a service" paradigm, is required to maximise its reuse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data exchange, access, and reuse are key requirements for efficient and transparent end-to-end public procurement. Because of this, we observe a shift in focus from the definition of procurement process standards for system-to-system exchange, to the development of data standards for publishing e-Procurement data in open, machine-readable formats (see Chapter 4 Related Ontologies/Vocabularies and Projects).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key challenge is that procurement data exists in different systems across the European Union:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the relations between the different concepts in the procurement chain and data flow are not fully documented, therefore data and data relationships cannot be reused directly in a flexible and comparable manner;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some data has inherited formats from its paper origins leading to illogical business processes and incorrect conceptual models;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>different systems use different data formats therefore reuse of information is not always efficient; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taxonomies like CPV are often not used correctly which creates serious problems e.g., making it very difficult for SMEs to find suitable business opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given the increasing importance of data standards for e-Procurement, a number of initiatives driven by the public sector, industry, and academia have been initiated in recent years. Some have grown organically, while others are the result of standardisation work. The vocabularies and the semantics that they introduce, the phases of public procurement that they cover, and the technologies that they use all differ. These differences hamper data interoperability and reuse. This creates the need for a common data standard for publishing procurement data, hence allowing data from different sources to be easily accessed and linked, and consequently reused. The e-Procurement ontology (henceforth referred to as the ePO) introduced by this study attempts to address this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_proposed_solution"><a class="anchor" href="#_proposed_solution"></a>1.2. Proposed solution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ultimate objective of the ePO is to deliver a common and agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualise, formally encode, and make available in an open, structured, and machine-readable format, data about public procurement. The ontology will cover the public procurement process from end to end, i.e. from notification, through tendering to awarding, ordering, invoicing and finally payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not the intention of the ePO to reinvent the wheel by redefining existing terms or processes, but rather to unify all existing practices, thus facilitating seamless exchange, access and reuse of data.</p>

<p>Process, Methodology and Technology discuss in detail the open process and methodology that will be followed for developing the ePO.</p>

<p class="tableblock"><em>In order to facilitate the understandability of the public procurement process, the parties involved in procurement processes, as well as citizens, journalists, and regulators, should be able to access procurement data easily in a structured and machine-readable format. Many stakeholders aim at gaining a quick understanding of the  information provided rather than performing an in-depth analysis of the published documentation. Currently, two main challenges exists. Firstly, data coming from different e-Procurement systems are often fragmented, reflecting the compatibility challenges between  source systems. Second, the data is available in different formats and representations, which are not always consistent and interoperable, and are therefore hard to connect and interlink. By providing a common view over e-Procurement data, the ePO will allow providers of procurement data to link their data and make it available in ways which will be easier for the non-technical consumer to interpret and reuse, in order to create a complete view of the public procurement process.</em></p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">A watchdog would like to understand how a public administration purchases goods and services. Their main goal is to understand the procedure and gain visibility of all the procedural steps. Procurement procedures often consist of complicated documents and processes, which are scattered on different platforms and websites, and are not always understood by the wide public. As all procurement data is now represented and made available using the ePO, the watchdog can easily combine data from different sources, thereby providing the context for understanding the information.</p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Information requirements:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">In this case it is required that:</p>

* <em>identify complex data deriving from different sources; and</em>
* <em>create compelling stories (e.g. through data visualisation techniques) which can be easily communicated and understood by the wider public.</em>
<em>By providing a common way to describe e-Procurement resources and data, the ePO will enable data journalists to identify, extract integrate and analyse relevant information coming from different sources.</em></p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">A journalist in France is writing an article about the total number and volume (in Euro) of tenders in the domain of transportation by looking at different data sources in the country, and also by comparing the French data with data from neighbouring countries, such as Belgium and Spain. As all data has been modelled using the ePO, it is easy for the journalist to identify all the data that is related to procurement procedures and the resulting invoices. The journalist is then able to integrate and analyse the data related to transportation, and produce data visualisations based on the organisation and location data of the tenders.</p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Information requirements:</strong></p>

<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>

Using the ePO as the common model for representing data allows the watchdog to find their way through the different sources that have to be consulted, e.g. budget dataset, calls for tender and procurement notices, and to interlink the data in order to identify the trails. Examples of the data to be interlinked by the watchdog, in order to  discover the flow of money could be:

In order to improve and further automate the audit process, different data should be made available in structured, machine-readable formats so that different data sources can be referenced and integrated. The creation of the ePO will be a first step towards achieving such integration.</em></p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">While auditing the evidence submitted by the tenderer who was awarded the contract, the auditor noticed that the supplier did not comply with the location criteria that were agreed during the signing of the contract. The collated payment evidence proved that by disregarding the initial agreement, the supplier had leased services from outside of the European Union to reduce the cost of the works. Publishing e-Procurement data in a structured, linked, and machine-readable format, allows the interconnection of data on transactions, criteria, contracts, and evidences from different sources, e.g. including BRIS and ECRIS, thus facilitating cross-checking and automated fraud detection.</p>

<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">An economic operator submits a tender to DG Informatics of the European Commission. The offer is written based on the criteria defined by the contracting authority in the tender specifications.

<p class="tableblock">A Spanish public administration procures stationery and textbooks for the forthcoming year. The public administration publishes the call for tenders on an online platform.

Applying e-Procurement data analytics could be advantageous for economic operators, contacting authorities, and external parties such as journalists and watchdogs. Applying data analysis techniques to e-Procurement data allows stakeholders not only to understand public procurement better, but also to take better informed, evidence-based decisions. In order to fully exploit the potential data analytics in e-Procurement, data should be published in machine-readable formats, in which the ePO plays a major role, and (preferably) linked open data.

<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">The European Commission aims to leverage its decision-making capability during a call for tenders in telecommunications by analysing all the data available about the potential suppliers and forecasting a fair market price. The European Commission aims at ensuring that the contract will be awarded to the supplier that provides the best services at the best price.

<p class="tableblock"><em>The European Union aims at providing a competitive economic environment for economic operators from different Member States. In order to achieve such a competitive environment, economic operators, public administrations, researchers, and academia should be able to access and exchange procurement information coming from different sources around Europe, allowing them to participate in calls for tenders from procurers from different Member States. Similarly, contracting authorities should be able to access information about economic operators, which are based in different Member States, and submit tenders for procured services. Making e-Procurement data available in common well-structured and machine-readable formats enhances cross-domain and trans-European competiveness by allowing economic operators from any Member State to participate in public procurement in any other Member State.</em></p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p class="tableblock">The VAT authority of a Member state wants to monitor the activity of a certain economic operator. By having all procurement data in all Member States published in a common and machine readable format, this data can be integrated into the systems of the VAT authority.

<p>The CEN Workshop on business interoperability interfaces for public procurement in Europe (CEN WS/BII), established in March 2007, had the objective of providing a basic framework for technical interoperability in pan-European electronic transactions. It delivered a complete set of profiles covering both the pre-award and the post-award phases of the public procurement. The existence of these profiles and their associated semantic data models has been key in allowing disparate solutions to interoperate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These profiles describe aspects throughout the whole procurement process such as notifications, the call for tenders, awarding and contracting.
These profiles were implemented in several projects in Europe: the European Commission used them to build e-Prior, their open source solution for electronic invoicing and ordering, now also covering the pre-award phases; the PEPPOL  community has also used them to create their own BIS specifications, resulting in a national-wide deployment of electronic invoicing in countries such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and other public administrations in Europe are currently basing their IT infrastructure and electronic procurement policies on deploying these standards e.g.,the National Health Service of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>These semantic models and their mappings to XML document exchange syntaxes, such as UBL and UN/CEFACT, should now be converted into knowledge to enable them to go a step further, by promoting a whole set of new functionalities such as searching for opportunities by sellers, comparing offers by buyers, getting statistical data, or improving the control and transparency in the electronic procurement procedures in the European Union.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2015, CEN established a new technical committee (TC) whose purpose is to develope standards to support and facilitate the electronic exchange of information in public procurement [8]: CEN/TC 440. The technical committee will develop semantic data models, based on CEN/BII. TC/440 will closely collaborate with CEN/TC 434, a technical committee for the development of standards supporting European Electronic Invoicing [9]. The work of CEN/TC 440 and TC 434 is closely related to the development of the ePO. Therefore synergies between CEN TC/440, TC 434 and the ePO should be developed as far as possible.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Universal Business Language (UBL) has been designated by the European Commission as one of the first consortium standards officially eligible for referencing in tenders from Public Administrations and is freely available to everyone without legal encumbrance or licensing fees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>UBL is the result of an international effort to define a royalty-free library of standard electronic XML business documents, such as purchase orders and invoices.It is designed to plug into existing legal, business, auditing, and records management practices, eliminating the re-keying of data in existing fax and paper-based supply chains and being an entry point into e-commerce for SMEs [12]. It is also used by nations around the world for implementing cross-border transactions related to sourcing (e.g. tendering), procurement (e.g. electronic invoicing), replenishment (e.g. managed inventory) and transportation (e.g. waybills and status).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard is the foundation for several European Public Procurement frameworks, including EHF (Norway) , Svefaktura (Sweden) , OIOUBL (Denmark) , e-Prior (European Commission DIGIT) , and PEPPOL  [13].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Universal Business Language provides a list of business objects expressed as reusable data components (e.g. address and payment) and common business documents (e.g. order and invoice), schemas for reusable data components and schemas for reusable business documents. Business objects from UBL that relate to the procurement field, include Invitation for Tender, Submission of Qualification Information and Awarding of Tenders. UBL Document Schemas related to e-Procurement include, for example, Call for Tenders. An example of these objects and how the relate, is described below.</p>

<p>Since the UBL is the basis for many e-Procurement systems, as described above, it is considered a well-established standard. Therefore, it cannot be neglected when developing the ePO.

<h4 id="_the_european_single_procurement_document"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_european_single_procurement_document"></a>4.1.4. The European Single Procurement Document</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In January 2016, the European Commission adopted the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) , a document that aims to considerably reduce the administrative burden for companies, in particular SMEs who want to have a fair chance at winning a public contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve this the ESPD maps out and replaces equivalent certificates issued by local public authorities or third parties involved in the procurement process, which can differ drastically between Member States.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While some countries have already introduced some form of “self-declaration” of suitability, others require all interested parties to provide full documentary evidence of their suitability, financial status and abilities. The ESPD will allow businesses to electronically self-declare that they meet the necessary regulatory criteria or commercial capability requirements, and only the winning company will need to submit all the documentation proving that it qualifies for the contract [14].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make full use of the ESPD concept, the European Commission will establish a service available for both suppliers and buyers, developing and providing the ESPD service free of charge to Member States and European Institutions. It will be provided as open source, so it can be implemented by service providers for their own use and to provide added value to buyers and suppliers [15].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With regard to technical requirements, the transmission will be done through e-Tendering solutions. As the service works in conjunction with e-Certis, business registers and e-Tendering solutions, great care will be taken to harmonise the semantic data model. Development will be linked to e-SENS, the standardisation initiatives of CEN, the ISA Core Business Vocabulary, and solution providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conclusion, the main objective of the ESPD is to reduce the administrative burden for buyers and suppliers participating in public procurement procedures. The ESPD service will reduce that burden by removing the need to produce a substantial number of certificates and documentation related to exclusion and selection criteria <mark>during the initial submission phase?</mark>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement states that Member States should ensure that contracting authorities and contracting entities receive and process invoices electronically.
The European Commission tasked CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, with developing a standard semantic data model, including business terms and rules, representing the core content of an e-invoice. The development in CEN is based on the CENBII Core Invoice data model and takes other international standards into account [17]. Member States shall adopt, publish and apply the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest by 27 November 2018.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>e-Certis  is a free online source of information to help companies and contracting authorities deal with the different forms of documentary evidence required in cross-border tenders for public contracts. e-Certis presents the different certificates frequently requested in procurement procedures across the EU [18]. In particular, e-Certis can help companies to find out which certificates issued in their country they need to include in tender files submitted to an authority in any partner country, or contracting authorities to establish which documents issued by a partner country to confirm the eligibility of a tender are equivalent to the certificates they themselves require.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>e-Certis is a reference tool and not a service of legal advice. The information contained in the database is provided by the national authorities and updated on a regular basis [19].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>e-Certis describes the documents using the following metadata:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Document type set, e.g. “Certificate required to participate in public procurements”;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ISA Core Vocabularies were created in collaboration with and by international working groups facilitated by the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme of the European Union . Their aim is to facilitate the exchange of information in the context of European Public Services and address interoperability problems such as the lack of commonly agreed data models and universal reference data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Core Vocabularies are simplified, re-usable and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity in a context-neutral fashion. Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts [20]:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources and create a data mesh-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers, and public service portals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently available vocabularies are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Core Person vocabulary: captures the fundamental characteristics of a person, e.g. the name, the gender, the date of birth, the location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core Public Service vocabulary: captures the fundamental characteristics of a service offered by public administration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core Business vocabulary: captures the fundamental characteristics of a legal entity (e.g. its identifier, activities) which is created through a formal registration process, typically in a national or regional register.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*Core Public Organization vocabulary: captures the fundamental characteristics of public organizations in the European Union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core Location vocabulary: captures the fundamental characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name or a geometry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core Criterion &amp; Core Evidence vocabulary: describes the principles and means that a private entity must fulfil in order to be qualified to perform public services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of the above vocabularies, the Core Criterion &amp; Core Evidence, Core Business, Core Public Organization, and Core Person vocabularies can be especially useful for the eProcurement ontology as they describe fundamental parties and elements of public procurement contracts. Also, The Core Location vocabulary can provide a solution for describing any location data needed.</p>

<h4 id="_the_public_procurement_ontology"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_public_procurement_ontology"></a>4.2.3. The Public Procurement Ontology</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PPROC ontology has been developed under the Public Procurement Optimization through Semantic Technologies Project (CONTSEM). This project is jointly undertaken by iASoft, the University of Zaragoza, ARAID (Government Agency of Aragon), the Government of Aragón, the Provincial Council of Huesca, and the town halls of Huesca and Zaragoza. The main purpose of the project is to add semantic technologies to the software used by public authorities for procurement procedures to publish data about public contracts. More specifically, one of the core objectives is to describe, semantically, the information published in official procurement bulletins [21].
CONTSEM participants developed the PPROC ontology in accordance with Spanish laws and European laws in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PPROC ontology defines the necessary concepts needed to describe the public procurement process and its contracts by effectively extending the Public Contracts Ontology. The main Class of the PPROC ontology is the pproc:Contract class, as the contract is considered to be the core concept of every procurement, as represented in Figure 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 3. Figure 3: Contract Class and subclasses [21]</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other core Classes of the ontology which describe different aspects of procurement are the following represented in Figure 4: core classes of PPROC [21].</p>

<div class="title">Figure 4. Figure 4: core classes of PPROC [21]</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To describe all other concepts relevant to procurement contracts, the ontology reuses various ontologies and schemes. For example, the following solutions are reused: the Organization Ontology, the Schema.org scheme, the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) ontology, the Good Relations Ontology, and the Dublin Core Metadata terms scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PPROC ontology examined as a possibility for reuse in the ePO as it is extensive in its coverage, compatible with European procurement processes, well documented, and already extensively reuses existing established vocabularies.</p>

<h4 id="_loted2"><a class="anchor" href="#_loted2"></a>4.2.4. LOTED2</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LOTED  (Linked Open Tenders Electronic Daily) is an ontology for the representation of European public procurement notices developed by the Knowledge Media Institute  of the Open University.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was created following the initiatives around the creation of linked data-compliant representations of information regarding tender notices in Europe, with the aim of addressing a specific problem plaguing previous efforts.
Until now projects developing legal ontologies have attempted to represent the legal concepts and the case-based reasoning behind them in linked data simply by mapping them in OWL. However, due to the high level of detail and the nuances of legal reasoning, this approach resulted in extremely complex vocabularies. Complexity is unwanted in semantic applications because for intelligence to arise from linking heterogeneous data, the datasets in question must be flexible enough to integrate effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The LOTED2 model seeks to find a balance between accurately representing the complex legal concepts and the reasoning behind them, and retaining the usability required for semantic applications. [22]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specifically LOTED2 has been designed for the following purposes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>to express the main legal concepts of the domain of public contracts notices as defined in legal sources (e.g. European Directives on public contracts);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to support rich semantic annotation, indexing, search and retrieval of tenders documents, such as contract notices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to enable the integration with other ontologies and vocabularies about related domains; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to make the reuse of semi structured data extracted from the TED system possible, as shown in Figure 5 Semi-Structured data extracted from TED.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Figure 5 Semi-Structured data extracted from TED</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LOTED2 is organized into the following 10 independent and reusable core modules which collectively represent 180 Classes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Loted2-core module:</strong> acts as the framework for the other modules;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Procurements Subjective Scope module:</strong> describes the classes of legal persons who are empowered to issue a tender notice (e.g. contracting authorities, contracting entities);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tender Documents module:</strong> this module provides a full description of tender documents (e.g. The majority of tender documents available on the TED system are described following this structure);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Procurement Regulation module:</strong> this module describes the legislative sources regulating public procurement domain;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Procurement Competitive Process module:</strong> this module describes the competitive process of the procurement (e.g. type of competition, qualification process, award procedure);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subjective Legal Situations module:</strong> this module describes the roles played by agents in the procurement process (e.g. role of the tenderer, role of the awarding legal entity);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed Contract module:</strong> this module describes the details of the contract to be awarded;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tender Bid module:</strong> this module describes the tender bid;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Entity module:</strong> this module describes the entities to whom the invitation to submit an offer for a proposed public contract is addressed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top module:</strong> this module contains abstract classes used to integrate LOTED2 with other core legal ontologies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of ePO, the LOTED2 vocabulary could be useful as a means of enriching the data represented by the ePO with legal context. Also helpful is the fact that it is already designed with compatibility with TED data in mind.</p>

<h3 id="_the_linked_open_economy_ontology"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_linked_open_economy_ontology"></a>4.3. The Linked Open Economy ontology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linked Open Economy (LOE) ontology was developed for the purposes of the EU funded project YourDataStories.eu. It was created to address the problem of the poor quality of open economic data becoming available as more governments around the world open their data to the public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linked Open Economy ontology is a top-level, generic conceptualization that aims to enrich and interlink the publicly available economic open data by modelling the flows incorporated in public procurement along with the market process to address complex policy issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linked Open Economy approach is a simple scalable model designed to describe data ranging from public procurement, budgets and spending to market prices. As such it can be easily tailored to a multitude of individual project needs. It also extensively uses existing vocabularies to make integration of heterogeneous data easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Table 11 in annex 7.1 summarizes Classes of the LOE ontology as used in the YourDataStories project .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linked Open Economy model is an interesting case to look into for reuse as it is quite generic could prove useful, depending on whether it can be tailored to the needs of the ePO.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_payments_ontology"><a class="anchor" href="#_payments_ontology"></a>4.4. Payments ontology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Payments ontology was created in 2010 by the Local eGovernment Standards Body and the Local Government Group as a part of the UK government&#8217;s transparency drive, which requested that all UK local authorities publish detailed information on their spending.
The Payments ontology is a general purpose vocabulary for publishing organizational spending data. It is built on the Data Cube vocabulary and represents payment data, which is typically described as a multi-dimensional table.
The main concept of the ontology is that of a Payment, which is associated with a Payer, a Payee and a Date. The ontology then provides a number of optional properties to further describe the payment, such as the specific government department responsible or related expenditure line, and to structure the data Cube according to needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is an example of a payment:Payment instance:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Payments Ontology can be considered for reuse in the post award stage of the procurement process to model the spending. Its suitability should be discussed however, as it is based on the Data Cube vocabulary, which although suitable for specific kinds of analysis, may prove less than ideal for integration with the rest of the data, as it may be modelled in a different format.</p>

<h4 id="_paraguayan_procurement_ontology"><a class="anchor" href="#_paraguayan_procurement_ontology"></a>4.4.1. Paraguayan procurement ontology</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DNCP  (National Public Procurement Portal) of open data, set up by the government, was created to provide access to data of public procurement in Paraguay and promote the development of creative tools that were attractiveof  and service citizens.
This initiative aimed to promote transparency, efficiency, citizen participation, and economic development by exposing the work done in various institutions, showing how they are managed and how they invest public resources.
Table 12 in annex 7.2 lists all Classes used in the Paraguayan Procurement Ontology.
Although the Paraguayan Procurement ontology aims to serve a similar purpose as the ePO, two problems with regards to its reuse were identified. First, the Paraguayan Procurement ontology is modelled completely in Spanish, which limits its reusability in the multilingual EU context. Secondly, the ontology is tailored to the local process.  However the ideas behind the ontology could provide an interesting insight.</p>

<p>The Single Electronic Data Interchange Area (SEDIA) is a major strategic initiative that aims to create a master data repository of external stakeholders making business with the European Commission, whether business means grants or tenders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of the SEDIA project to create a fully automated and integrated process for handling procurement and grants information, strictly limiting the manual input of data to a minimum, and promoting the alignment and reuse of such data along the whole process. This requires the implementation of solutions based on interoperability of the different systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a process where the actors would not have to submit recurrent information over and over again, but would allow reuse of information previously submitted. Each piece of data that needs to be dealt with should be encoded only once, and then reused or updated according to the needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to achieve the envisaged interoperability a basic common understanding of the data dealt with is required. Therefore a common data model is to be created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SEDIA vocabulary is currently a work in progress. It started by mapping all relevant existing vocabularies and standards to ensure that it achieves its envisioned interoperability, and is in the process of creating a vocabulary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this vocabulary we describe all concepts that are part of the procurement process, and whose attributes are relatively static over time, as this is a vocabulary aiming to underpin a repository of stakeholders. Examples of such information are business and organization addresses, names, formal IDs, banking details etc.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Common Data Model (CDM) is the metadata model of the resources published by the Publications Office of the EU. The model is based on the FRBR  model, being able to represent the relationships between the resource types managed by the Publications Office. Initially the focus was on metadata related to legal resources and general publications. in a later phase metadata for TED and CORDIS were added. The CDM includes different classes and properties that relate to e-Procurement . The CDM wiki  explains which classes and properties are defined in the CDM and how they relate to each other. For example, the CDM defines a Public Procurement class as any of the works related to public procurement (Ted). The model also defines a Prior Information Notice class as a subclass of Public Procurement. The Public Procurement has, among others, the following properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submission date;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUTS original reference;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPV original title;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eTendering URL;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document number in the Official Journal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directive name;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides defining classes and properties, the CDM also defines relationships between concepts, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public procurement has original CPV concept;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public procurement has current CPV concept;</p>

<li>
<p>Public procurement value expressed in a given currency;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public procurement notice published in official journal;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CDM can help us understand how different metadata concepts of e-Procurement relate to each other. The ePO will respect the naming and design rules of the CDM. Moreover, as the CDM is available in OWL, its elements can be reused by the e-Procurement Ontology wherever possible.</p>

<p>Following the adoption of the revised e-Procurement Directives, a new set of standard forms for public procurement was introduced. With the new directives, the forms are meant to be used in an electronic format only, which allows for automatic checking of mandatory fields. Moreover, the clear structure of electronic notices ensure consistency with the European Directives and minimize the risk of encoding errors. The forms, which are available via SIMAP, impose a structure for submitting the following information:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The standard forms for public procurement are very important for the development of the ePO as they describe how public procurement data should be submitted for publication in order to comply with the public procurement directives. Since the ePO has to be compliant with the same directives, it should take into account the concepts, data structure and controlled vocabularies of the standard forms for public procurement. Moreover, in 2015, the Publications Office and the ISA Programme of the EU conducted a study to elicit information and functional requirements from TED reusers [23]. The requirements identified by this study could be considered when developing the ePO.</p>

<h4 id="_the_common_procurement_vocabulary"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_common_procurement_vocabulary"></a>4.5.1. The Common Procurement Vocabulary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV)  was created by the European Commission in order to facilitate the processing of invitations to tenders published in the Official Journal of the EU by means of a single classification system to describe the subject matter of public contracts. This classification endeavours to cover all requirements for supplies, works and services [24].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CPV consists of a main vocabulary for defining the subject of a contract, and a supplementary vocabulary for adding further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure comprising of codes of up to nine digits associated with a wording that describes the supplies, works, or services forming the subject of the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if a contracting entity wants to obtain a road transport service for a fragile high-tech device, it may be interested in looking into the following codes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>60100000-9 Road transport services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60110000-6 Public road transport services</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example could be if an entity is interested in buying general-purpose rolling machines and parts for them. In order to find the most suitable codes, it could look into the following codes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>42000000-6 Industrial machinery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>42930000-4 Centrifuges, calendering or vending machines</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The supplementary vocabulary may be used to expand the description of the subject of a contract. The items are made up of an alphanumeric code with a corresponding wording allowing further details to be added regarding the specific nature or destination of the goods to be purchased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, specific metals may be designated with the supplementary vocabulary codes: AA08-2 (Tin) or AA09-5 (Zinc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the CPV is mandatory for all public procurement procedures in the European Union as from 1 February 2006 [25].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CPV should be used in the case of the ePO as it is obligatory by directive. Furthermore as it is a wide spread and well established standard, its inclusion will facilitate integration and reuse of published data. An update of these CPVs are also foreseen within the ISA action: European Public Procurement Interoperability Initiative which also covers the ePO.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Named Authority Lists (NALs) are harmonised code lists with multilingual labels used to facilitate data exchange. They are maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union in the Metadata Registry under the governance of the EU&#8217;s Interinstitutional Metadata Maintenance Committee (IMMC).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of common, high-quality reference data in information reuse can significantly reduce semantic interoperability conflicts. Available in different machine-readable formats and maintained by a trusted authority, the NALs can be reused in many different information exchange contexts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples of NALs that could be used in the domain of e-Procurement are those on countries, currencies, documentation types, EU programmes and EU corporate bodies [26].</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), is a geographical nomenclature subdividing the economic territory of the European Union into regions at three different levels: NUTS 1, 2 and 3 respectively, moving from larger to smaller territorial units, as it is shown in Figure 6.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. Figure 6: The three different levels of NUTS [27]</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NUTS classification is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the EU for the purpose of [27]:
* The collection, development and harmonisation of European regional statistics;
* Socio-economic analyses of the regions; and
<strong> NUTS 1: major socio-economic regions
</strong> NUTS 2: basic regions for the application of regional policies
<strong> NUTS 3: small regions for specific diagnoses
* Framing of EU regional policies.
</strong> Regions eligible for support from cohesion policy have been defined at NUTS 2 level.
** The Cohesion report has so far mainly been prepared at NUTS 2 level. Despite the aim of ensuring that regions of comparable size all appear at the same NUTS level, each level still contains regions which differ greatly in terms of population. Further details can be found the NUTS publication 2013/EU-28 .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NUTS classification should be used for the purposes of the ePO when describing localities as it is obligatory in the public procurement directives .</p>

<h3 id="_identification_of_reusable_concepts"><a class="anchor" href="#_identification_of_reusable_concepts"></a>4.6. Identification of reusable concepts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In projects such as the creation of the ePO, it is important to reuse and combine existing concepts to the greatest extent possible. During  preliminary research into existing relevant works, a number of possible candidates for reuse have been identified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RDF vocabularies are the easiest to reuse in the ePO as they are already in the required format. This means that providing classes and properties expressing elements which need to be described by the ePO can be reused directly with little or no modification needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Payments ontology can be reused specifically for the description of elements relating to payments as it already contains properties describing all basic parts of a transaction: the payer, the payee, the amount, the date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of contracts, the Public Procurement Ontology provides a ready model for describing a contract and connecting it to relevant elements.  It offers a detailed breakdown of all types of contracts and of their parts, such as requirements and evidences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ISA Core vocabularies are perfect for describing the main parties of the procurement process. The Core Business vocabulary can be used to describe businesses competing for the contracts. The Core Public Organizations vocabulary can be used to describe the contracting authorities. The Core Evidence and Core Criterion vocabularies can be used to represent the criteria of the contracts and the evidences proving compliance with them. Finally the Core Location vocabulary can be used to describe any location data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The LOTED2 vocabulary can be used to provide all elements and parties of the procurement process with the legal depth required, such as legal contract details and awarding implications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linked Open Economy vocabulary, which is a rather generic model, could be used to tie together the rest of the vocabularies which are targeted to specific parts of the procurement process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Codelists and named authority lists are also easy to and should be reused. Especially if they are widely used, their inclusion in the ePO will facilitate interoperability and reuse of the data described by it. Specifically, the Common Procurement Vocabulary, as it stands now or an evolutions of it, can be used to identify the subject matter of contracts, and the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics classification can be used to encode locations. The Named Authority lists of the Publications Office can be used to define multiple things ranging from administrative entities, to currencies and to languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other existing works, which are merely standards or non-RDF models, can be reused in the sense that they can provide useful information for the modelling of the ePO and inform on important things to consider during its creation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion_and_next_steps"><a class="anchor" href="#_conclusion_and_next_steps"></a>5. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The objective of this deliverable was to collect the necessary information for starting the development of the e-Procurement Ontology, whicjh is a commonly agreed OWL ontology that will conceptualize and formally encode information describing public procurement in a structured and machine readable format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Towards achieving this goal, this document has identified use cases for the ePO. The use cases demonstrate how the ePO can foster transparency and help monitor public procurement, how it can promote innovation, and how it can interconnect different public procurement systems. Moreover, the target audience of the ePO has been identified. The target audience includes, but is not limited to, contracting authorities, economic operators, regulators and the media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides the target audience and use cases, a key objective of this work was to identify existing data standards and reference data which are relevant for e-Procurement. An initial assessment was conducted to identify the extent to which these existing solutions could be reused in the ePO. The analysis showed that many solutions can be reused directly, that some may provide guidance for aligning, and that some may be used for reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the ISA process and methodology for developing semantic agreements, [7] as mentioned in chapter 2, a next step would be to set up an open working group. A call for participation will be sent to stakeholder communities, inviting them to take part in the work. Once the working group members have been identified, roles and responsibilities will be assigned. The working group chairs, editors and experts will execute the operational work for developing the specification. They will have to agree on the use cases proposed in this work or identify further use cases, identify information requirements, and propose a set of core concepts for the ePO, taking into account the analysis of existing initiatives as presented in chapter 4, and a further in-depth analysis. In order to support their work, a collaboration environment should be set up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The collaboration environment could be hosted on Joinup , an online platform developed by the European Commission to help public administrations find, share, reuse, and develop interoperability solutions. The platform would allow members of the working group to post and discuss issues, to share and review drafts of the ePO, and to communicate with each other in an open and efficient manner. A key task of the working group when developing the ePO, would be to define naming and identifier conventions. A persistent Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) would have to be identified for the classes and properties that are defined in the ontology. A review group could be established to challenge and validate the proposals of the working group.</p>
